This program will enable you to submit all your Wunderlist data backup into a specific Trello board.

----------------------------

STEP BY STEP PROCEDURE :

1. First of all, you will need to export your data from Wunderlist as a JSON file.
To get a JSON file of your Wunderlist data, please follow instructions at : https://6wunderkinder.desk.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2364564-how-can-i-backup-export-my-data-

2. Then, you will need to initialize the four string constants :
- WUNDERLIST_BACKUP_FILENAME : must be set with the full path of the Wunderlist backup JSON file.

- TRELLO_KEY : must be set with your personal Trello API key.
Please log in to Trello website and go to this URL : https://trello.com/app-key
The Trello API key is the first ID given in this Web page.

- TRELLO_TOKEN : must be set with a token that you had generated.
Please log in to Trello website and go to this URL : https://trello.com/app-key
Look for the link to generate manually a token, in order to get your own token.

- TRELLO_BOARD_SHORTID : must be set with the real ID of your targetted board.
Please open the targetted board in the Trello website and check your URL.
You will have to replace the name of your board by "reports.json"
https://trello.com/b/abcdefgh/my-board-name into https://trello.com/b/abcdefgh/reports.json
Launch the URL updated in your browser and get your Trello board short ID in the first field "id" of the JSON structure of your board.

3. You're free to run the program and get all your Wunderlist tasks submitted to your Trello board.

Enjoy !
